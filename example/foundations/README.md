### Foundations

This development includes several proofs of foundational interest.

1. The halting problem is undecidable.
2. Thence the principle of the excluded middle is invalid.
3. Type-checking is undecidable; `member(-; -)` is undecidable
4. CTT is predicative (i.e. no universe contains itself), proved via Russell's Paradox.
